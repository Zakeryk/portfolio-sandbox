# SYNC

## the vision
call someone only when they're thinking about you too.

## the problem
nobody calls anymore. why?
- fear of rejection (sent to voicemail = feels bad)
- timing anxiety ("are they busy?")
- text asking "can i call?" is lame and formal
- standing DMs create guilt ("i should respond but...")

## the solution
**double-blind handshake with plausible deniability**

you tap their name. they tap yours. if both happen within 1 minute → instant audio connection.
if not? request evaporates. no trace. no guilt. your ego stays intact.

## the magic moment
when it connects, it feels like telepathy.
"hey i was literally just thinking about you"

that dopamine hit >> any social media like.

## core mechanic: the seek

### user A seeks user B
1. A taps B's name in friend list
2. A enters "seeking mode" - screen pulses gently
3. 60 second window opens
4. nothing happens on B's end yet

### if B seeks A back (within 60 sec)
1. B sees A's name glowing subtly (if they open the app)
2. B taps A's name
3. **BOOM** - instant audio connection
4. magic moment achieved

### if 60 seconds pass
1. A's pulsing UI fades out silently
2. no notification for B
3. no "missed call" badge
4. request deleted from existence
5. zero rejection, zero guilt

## quantum pings (secondary interaction)

lower-stakes, longer-window way to signal "thinking of you"

### user A sends quantum ping to B
1. A long-presses (or swipes) B's name
2. subtle haptic feedback
3. **no visible UI change**
4. **B gets no notification**
5. signal lasts 24 hours

### if B pings A back (within 24h)
1. **mutual match detected**
2. push notification to **both**: "🧠 Crossed Minds with [name]"
3. both open app to special "crossed minds" screen
4. optional: transition to instant call or just acknowledgment

### if 24h passes
- signal expires silently
- no notification
- no trace

**the vibe**: less urgent than instant call, more meaningful than a like. you're putting a thought into the universe, and if they're doing the same, you both find out.

## the laws

### 1. no rejection feedback
if someone doesn't respond to your seek, you never know if they:
- ignored you
- weren't on their phone
- were busy
- didn't have the app open

plausible deniability is the feature.

### 2. ephemeral by default
no call history (unless explicitly saved).
no timestamps of "who sought who".
what happens in the moment, stays in the moment.

### 3. frictionless connection
when both people want to talk, it just happens.
zero friction. no "ringing". no "calling...".
just instant audio.

### 4. presence, not availability
you see who's online, but not "available to talk".
online = they have the app open.
that's it.

### 5. tight window (1 minute)
makes every connection feel serendipitous.
you can't game it. you can't force it.
it either happens or it doesn't.

## friend model

### primary: phone contacts
- auto-match by phone number
- simple, familiar, zero friction
- privacy-first (no public directory)

### secondary: username links
- optional `@username` creation
- shareable link: `sync.app/@username`
- **NOT searchable** (no public directory)
- use case: dating app matches who don't have your # yet
- recipient opens link → adds as friend → can now sync

## vibe check
- **not** a social network (no feeds, no likes, no posts)
- **not** a messenger (calls only, no text)
- **not** a dating app (but works great for new connections)
- **is** a tool for authentic connection
- **is** designed to respect attention
- **is** built for serendipity, not scheduling

## success metrics (internal)
- match rate: % of seeks that connect within 60 sec
- network density: avg friends per user who actually sync
- retention: users who sync at least once/week
- magic moments: subjective but we'll know

## anti-metrics (things we don't optimize for)
- total seeks sent (more ≠ better)
- time spent in app (less is fine)
- daily active users (quality > quantity)
- virality coefficient (word of mouth > growth hacks)

## why this wins
1. **network effect built in**: you need friends on it for it to work
2. **spreads in tight friend groups**: "download this so we can sync"
3. **solves a real problem**: calling is broken, this fixes it
4. **emotional payoff**: connection feels magical, not transactional
5. **respects attention**: no notifications spam, no guilt

## what this isn't
- not trying to replace texts
- not trying to replace scheduled calls
- not trying to be "the everything app"

this is for spontaneous connection with people you actually care about.
